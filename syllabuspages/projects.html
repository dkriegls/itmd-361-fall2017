            <li>
              NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style in your content page. 
            </li>					
            <li>
              All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF),

              Valid, well-formed semantic HTML5. Projects whose HTML does not validate with the
              <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> will receive a zero-point,
              failing grade. Get in the habit early of validating your HTML before you commit to Git.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only structural, semantic uses of HTML elements and attributes. <b>Absolutely no</b>
              table markup, break tags, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout.
              (All layout and design will be handled via CSS in the next project. For this project, I
              urge you not to spend much time at all looking at your pages in a browser. Stick close
              to your source code and the HTML validator.)
